                    <p>My name is <strong>Bouchoucha Samy Elias</strong>, I am <strong>23 years old</strong>, and I live in <strong>Béjaïa</strong>, a coastal city in Algeria. For as long as I can remember, <strong>computing and technology</strong> have always been central to my life. From a young age, I was captivated by computers, software, and all kinds of tech. This <strong>passion</strong>, which grew with me over the years, naturally led me to become an <strong>IT specialist</strong>. Today, I work with a variety of technologies and programming languages to create <strong>tailored IT solutions</strong> that meet the unique needs of each project.</p>

                    <p> My expertise spans both <strong>web development</strong>, such as interactive dashboards and management systems, and <strong>desktop applications</strong> for professional environments. I also enjoy designing modern, functional, and aesthetically pleasing <strong>websites</strong>, with a strong focus on <strong>performance and design</strong>. Every project I work on is an opportunity for me to tackle <strong>new challenges</strong>, learn, and refine my skills. Whether it’s for clients looking to develop <strong>custom applications</strong>, optimize business processes, or simply strengthen their online presence, I am committed to delivering <strong>high-quality results</strong> while being attentive to their needs and objectives.</p>

                    <p><strong>Fullstack development</strong> is more than just a job for me, it’s a <strong>passion</strong>. I love the idea of actively contributing to improving the digital tools we use every day.</p>

                    <p>If you’re looking for a <strong>developer</strong> capable of turning your ideas into reality, I’d be delighted to accompany you on this journey!</p>
